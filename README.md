# Unified Dashboard

This dashboard is intended to unify data from multiple sources (SOASTA, AppDynamics, Dynatrace etc) and serve as a single point of truth for IT Digital.

## Installation

Verify you have node and npm installed by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

Once verified, you need to install the required packages. Navigate to the root directory where the package.json file is and run:
```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

## Future Updates
